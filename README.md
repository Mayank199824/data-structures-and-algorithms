# DATA STRUCTURES IN C  

## Array
Array is a primitive data structure that stores a collection of similar kind(type) of data in an order(index).  

```int arr[5] = {1,23,54,64,45};```  

This is an array with space for 5 elements and it can only store data of integer type.  

## Stack  
Stack is an abstract data type based on First In Last Out i.e. the first element to be pushed to the stack will be the last to be pulled out. Like in a book stack, in order to get to the book at the bottom, you have to remove the books at the top.

**USES**: In Recursive functions  

## Queue  
Queue is also an abstract data type based on First In First Out i.e. the first element to be pushed to the queue will be the first one to be pulled out. Like in queue, the first person to get  in line will be first to go out.  

**USES**: In 

## List  
List is a similar data type to Array but it can store different kinds(types) of data rather than storing single kind of data.  

## Linked List
